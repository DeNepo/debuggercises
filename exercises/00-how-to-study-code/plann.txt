    all about the inner workings
      learning HTML & CSS was about applying rules
        you apply the rule
        the site happens
        the inner process isn't important for you
      learning javascript is about the inner process
    debugger as a study tool
      configuring tips
        move it to the left or the right
        open console drawer below sources tab
        close threads and callstack so you can focus on scope
        use the step button to go in smallest steps
        use breakpoints to skip over code you don't want to study
    program-state.js
      changes over time
      debugger
      console.log
    general study tips
      don't rush, understand
      work in pairs if possible

      predict!!!
      use the debugger
      read out loud
      draw on paper
      write lots of comments for yourself and your future self
        what were you thinking?
        what was confusing?
        what should you study more later?
  a study workflow
    1 - open a code example with JST (https://study.hackyourfuture.be/learning/learning-from-code#use-tools-to-visualize-program-memory-browser-vsc-debugger-js-tutor)
    2 - read aloud the line of the code that pointed with red arrow in human language, or better say translate it to yourself into meaningful human language (exercise comments aloud reading or Mosh video might come as a help with that, but your personal vocabulary might take a while to appear)
    3 - before pressing button next, ask yourself "which line might be next"
    4 - press Next and check yourself if you were right or wrong
    5 - ask yourself "what this line do"  and check what JST writes you at the right side (or sometimes in print output window at the right top side)
    5 - ask again "which line is next" and "what's gonna change" (or "what is gonna change in the memory")
    5 - finish the code using these steps
    6 - try it on with the exercises
  study examples
    - create a few files with study-comments
    read, modify, create
