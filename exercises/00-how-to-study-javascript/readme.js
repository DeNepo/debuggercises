/*  HOW TO STUDY JAVASCRIPT

    Studying JavaScript will be challenging
    the debuggercises way of learning is not glamorous
    You will need to change how you study, and very importantly

      you will need to adjust your learning expectations

    Studying JavaScript will be 100% different from learning HTML and CSS.
    HTML & CSS are all about learning and applying rules
    if you apply the rules correctly, your web page looks right
    You don't need to think about what happens between your code and the final web page

    Studying JavaScript is 100% about what happens in between!
    Programming is all about inner processes.
    You should focus 100% on what happens between starting your script and the final result
    You should focus on ...


  PROGRAM STATE

    Program State is a term that refers to the values stored in memory at EACH SPECIFIC moment
    The values can change often, sometimes at every step of your program!
    Learning to program requires you to understand:
    - how does the JS engine represent memory?
    - how is your code interpreted by the JS engine?
    - how does each instruction interact with program state?
    Your first goal is learning to see what is happening inside your program at each step:

    `console.log`: The simplest way to peek into program state, but logging has some huge limitations
      you will only log what you think of logging, there's a lot more going on!
      they don't help understand how your whole program's memory is represented

    debuggers: The best way to peek inside program state, but takes some practice to use effectively
      you can see every value in memory, at every step of your program's execution
      debuggers are designed to help you understand how memory is structured in JS


  GENERAL STUDY TIPS

    Read the rest of the files in this folder to learn a good study workflow

    Spend lots of time studying the examples
    - understand of what each line of code means (technically and humanly)
    - step through them one line at a time, following the workflows in this folder
    - predict!!! Always try guess what will happen before stepping your code
    - draw on paper, read out loud, do what you can to make the code more tangible

    Write lots of comments in the exercises and examples, your future self will thank you
    - what surprised you about each line? what did you learn from that surprise?
    - what should you study deeper next time you review this topic?
    - which other examples/exercises/resources/projects used this concept?
    - what random thoughts did you have while studying this?
    - ... you know you best, write whatever helps!

    A tiny relief: the solutions to many of the _'s in the exercises are written in the debugger
    ... if you know how to look for them

  Keep at it and you'll get there, one step at a time ;)
